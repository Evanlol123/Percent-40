## ✨ New Features (Hopefully)  
We're planning to bring some exciting new features to HIPPOSITE 2! Here's what's in the works:  

- 🌐 **Browser Functionality**  
  - We need a server to run this feature. If you can help, please create a ticket in our server!  

- 🕹️ **Games Tab**  
  - Not guaranteed, but we might have something else fun in the works.  

- 📂 **More Apps Section**  
  - We hope to include tabs for different categories like usage, server tools, and more.  

- 🚪 **Alternative Unblocking Methods**  
  - Beyond the 40% method (requires a server, so not guaranteed).  

- 🛠️ **ExtHang3r Integration**  
  - A tool made by [Blobby-Boi](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi)   (ExtHang3r [repo](https://github.com/blobby_boy)  )

- 🔄 **Auto-Update**  
  - Most likely not happening, but we’ll see!  

- And more! Stay tuned as we continue to brainstorm and build.
